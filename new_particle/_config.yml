  ADASE is a group of research enthusiasts pushing the state of the art at the intersection of kernel methods 3D data, 
  deep learning, online data, and machine learning. Our research mission is to construct data-driven (surrogate) models capable of predicting behavior, 
  performing model-based control and recommend future actions, optimizing design and performance and detecting anomalies and predict failures. Aside from traditional convex and non-convex optimization techniques, 
  we see great potential in modern artificial intelligence, mainly deep learning, 
  in order to achieve these goals. 
  Keywords - Machine Learning, Engineering Problems, Online Data, Kernel Methods, Gaussian Process, Deep Learning.
  
staff_description: >
  Since 2016 Evgeny Burnaev works as Associate Professor of Skoltech Center for Computational Data-Intensive Science and Engineering. 
  Today, Evgenyâ€™s research interests encompass the areas of regression based on Gaussian processes and kernel methods for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling and optimization, 
  Deep Learning for 3D Data Analysis and manifold learning, on-line sequence learning for prediction and non-parametric anomaly detection. 
  The main aim is development of new machine learning methods and their use for solution of applied engineering problems.
