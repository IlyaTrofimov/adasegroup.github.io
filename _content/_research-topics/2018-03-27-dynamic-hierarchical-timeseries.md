---

## Description

The objective here is to acquaint students with a real world problem and address it through an understanding of the state of the art in hierarchical time series with a dynamic component. After a throrough review reflected in a technical survey, students will proceed to implement a method of their choice or develop a new one and assess it against the state of the art on a real-world problem

## Objective

- Development of new methods for dynamic hierarchical time series
- Polishing of software development skills in python
- Understanding of the state of the art in time series modeling


## Data sets

- Private data set will be shared individually
