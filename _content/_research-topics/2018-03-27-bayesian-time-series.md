## Description 
In this project, students will do an overview of the state of the art methods for bayesian time series analysis including state space models, structured time series and others. It is expected that they provide a technical survey together with implementations tested on both private and public datasets

## Objective
- Familiarization with the state of the art in bayesian time series
- Sharpen development skills in Python
- Implementation and evaluation on a real-world data set

## Datasets
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting
- Private dataset will be shared individually

## Target audience
Ideal for students seeking to delve into the state of the art and apply it
