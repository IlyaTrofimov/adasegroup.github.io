title: Survey of bayesian non-parametric regression methods
inline: false
---

### Description

Students interested in Bayesian methods for machine learning can explore the state of the art in bayesian nonparametric methodologies and apply it to a real world problem. The objective is to do an overview survey of the state of the art and implement the different surveyed methods on a practical data set. This should be then benchmarked against parametric regression methods of your choice and a conclusion provided with the strengths and weaknesses of the Bayesian nonparametric methods

### Objective

- Delve into the literature of bayesian nonparametric
- Apply the state of the art into a real world problem
- Understand the weaknesses and strengths of BNP metods
- Polish python skills

### Data sets

### Target audience

Ideal for students interested in Bayesian methods
