abstract: We propose a novel multi-texture synthesis model based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a user-controllable mechanism. The user control ability allows to explicitly specify the texture which should be generated by the model. This property follows from using an encoder part which learns a latent representation for each texture from the dataset. To ensure a dataset coverage, we use an adversarial loss function that penalizes for incorrect reproductions of a given texture. In experiments, we show that our model can learn descriptive texture manifolds for large data sets and from raw data such as a collection of high-resolution photos. Moreover, we apply our method to produce 3D textures and show that it outperforms existing baselines.
