# Motivation
Full-scale/computational experiments are often expensive; in some cases “physical” models are not available at all.

# Goal
construct a data-driven (surrogate) model in order to:
- predict behavior;
- perform model-based control and recommend future actions;
- optimize design and performance;
- detect anomalies and predict failures.

# Challenges
1. Variable fidelity data sources (e.g. AT, computer models).
2. Data with complex shapes and structure
- sample is generated on a manifold;
- anisotropic sample distribution, including imbalanced distribution of labels;
- 3D object description (e.g. CAD model);
- multidimensional time-series data.
3. Local accuracy prediction is required.

# Tasks
- surrogate model construction and surrogate optimization;
- anomaly detection and rare events prediction (aka imbalanced classification);
- adaptive design of experiments (aka active learning);
- on-line learning for streaming data.
