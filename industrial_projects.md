### Applications of massive data processing and predictive maintenance technology
1. Prediction of failures in auxiliary power units
2. Aerodynamic design of efficient layouts for passenger aircraft
3. Design of the side panel of F1 car

### Applications of deep learning technology
1. 3D data processing
2. 3D shape recognition

### Development & implementation of software libaries

#### pSeven Core (MACROS Library) 
The library was developed for optimization and modeling of surrogate functions in collaboration with [DATADVANCE](https://www.datadvance.net/ru/) 

Quality assurance:
- Technology Readiness Level 6 (NASA classification)
- According to [Airbus experts](http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-to-reduce-lead-times-in-numerical-analysis-activities-for-aircraft-design/) , application of MACROS “provides the reduction of up to 10% of lead time and cost in several areas of the aircraft design process”
- Several joint projects with industry partners have been [successfully completed](http://www.aerospace-technology.com/news/newsairbus-uses-datadvances-macros-software-structural-analysis-a350-xwb-aircraft-4362144)

Use cases:
- Structural analysis of composite stiffened panels on aircrafts
- Aerodynamic design of layouts for passenger aircrafts

#### Library for predictive maintenance (PHM core)

Quality assurance:
- Technology Readiness Level 5 (NASA classification)

Use cases:
- Airplanes leakage detection
- APU failures prediction
- Oil filter clogging detection
- Software-intensive systems: detection of outages of internet user services
