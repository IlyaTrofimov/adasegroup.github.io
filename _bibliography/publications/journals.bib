abstract = {{Suppose that we are given two independent sets \(I_b\) and \(I_r\) of a graph such that \(|I_b| = |I_r|\), and imagine that a token is placed on each vertex in \(I_b\). Then, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">sliding token</span> problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence of independent sets which transforms \(I_b\) into \(I_r\) so that each independent set in the sequence results from the previous one by sliding exactly one token along an edge in the graph. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even for planar graphs, and also for bounded treewidth graphs. In this paper, we thus study the problem restricted to trees, and give the following three results: (1) the decision problem is solvable in linear time; (2) for a yes-instance, we can find in quadratic time an actual sequence of independent sets between \(I_b\) and \(I_r\) whose length (i.e., the number of token-slides) is quadratic; and (3) there exists an infinite family of instances on paths for which any sequence requires quadratic length.}}
