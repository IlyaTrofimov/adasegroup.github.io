abstract = {{Let \(I\), \(J\) be two given independent sets of a graph \(G\). Imagine that the vertices of an independent set are viewed as tokens (coins). A token is allowed to move (or slide) from one vertex to one of its neighbors. The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sliding Token</span> problem asks whether there exists a sequence of independent sets of \(G\) starting from \(I\) and ending with \(J\) such that each intermediate member of the sequence is obtained from the previous one by moving a token according to the allowed rule. In this paper, we claim that this problem is solvable in polynomial time when the input graph is a block graph---a graph whose blocks are cliques. Our algorithm is developed based on the characterization of a non-trivial structure that, in certain conditions, can be used to indicate a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">no</span>-instance of the problem. Without such a structure, a sequence of token slidings between any two independent sets of the same cardinality exists.}}

abstract = {{Given two independent sets \(I\) and \(J\) of a graph \(G\), imagine that a token (coin) is placed on each vertex in \(I\). Then, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sliding Token</span> problem asks if one could transforms \(I\) to \(J\) using a sequence of elementary steps, where each step requires sliding a token from one vertex to one of its neighbors, such that the resulting set of vertices where tokens are placed still remains independent. In this paper, we describe a polynomial-time algorithm for solving <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sliding Token</span> in case the graph \(G\) is a cactus. Our algorithm is designed based on two observations. First, all structures that forbid the existence of a sequence of token slidings between \(I\) and \(J\), if exist, can be found in polynomial time. A <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">no</span>-instance may be easily deduced using this characterization. Second, without such forbidden structures, a sequence of token slidings between \(I\) and \(J\) does exist.}}

abstract = {{Suppose that we are given two independent sets \(I_b\) and \(I_r\) of a graph such that \(|I_b| = |I_r|\), and imagine that a token is placed on each vertex in \(I_b\). Then, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">sliding token</span> problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence of independent sets which transforms \(I_b\) into \(I_r\) so that each independent set in the sequence results from the previous one by sliding exactly one token along an edge in the graph. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even for planar graphs, and also for bounded treewidth graphs. In this paper, we show that the problem is solvable for trees in quadratic time. Our proof is constructive: for a yes-instance, we can find an actual sequence of independent sets between \(I_b\) and \(I_r\) whose length (i.e., the number of token-slides) is quadratic. We note that there exists an infinite family of instances on paths for which any sequence requires quadratic length.}}
