# About Me

My name is **Hoàng Anh Đức** (in Vietnamese). I am a Vietnamese citizen.

In all of my publications, my name is written as **Duc A. Hoang**.

Currently, I am a Ph.D student at [Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/).

My supervisor is Professor [Ryuhei UEHARA](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~uehara/).

I am interested in theoretical computer science, especially on developing algorithms for graph problems.

Recently, I've been focusing on reconfiguration problems.

For more information, see my [list of publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/), and [list of participated events]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/), or take a look at my [Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.baseurl }}/CV.pdf).
