Advanced Data Analytics in Science and Engineering Group (ADASE) research is about **THIS AND THAT, EG** developing efficient machine learning methods and their use for solution of applied engineering problems and industrial analytics.
In particular, we are working on regression based on Gaussian processes and kernel methods for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling and optimization, Deep Learning for 3D Data Analysis and manifold learning, on-line sequence learning for prediction and non-parametric anomaly detection.

Our current core research areas are:
* [Deep learning for predictive analytics](/analytics)
* [Deep learning for analysis of 3D data](/3ddl)
* [Medical predictive analytics](/medical).

**We also work on THIS AND THAT:**
* [Project 1](/link_to_project1)
* [Project 2](/link_to_project2).
