<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>Often, full-scale computational experiments are expensive. In addition, there are situations where “physical” models are unavailable.</p>

<h1 id="objective">Objective</h1>
<p>To achieve this, our objetive is to construct data-driven (surrogate) models capable of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>predicting behavior</li>
  <li>performing model-based control and recommend future actions</li>
  <li>optimizing design and performance</li>
  <li>detecting anomalies and predict failures</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>There are several challenges involved in the construction of surrogate models such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The data sources have viariable degrees of fidelity (e.g. AT, computer models)</li>
  <li>Complex shapes and structure present in the data at hand. Some examples are:
    <ul>
      <li>The sample is generated on a manifold</li>
      <li>The data represents an anisotropic sample distribution or includes imbalanced distribution of labels</li>
      <li>The description of the data relates to a 3D object such as CAD models</li>
      <li>The data set is a multidimensional time-series</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Local accuracy prediction is required</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="tasks">Tasks</h1>
<ul>
  <li>surrogate model construction and surrogate optimization;</li>
  <li>anomaly detection and rare events prediction (aka imbalanced classification);</li>
  <li>adaptive design of experiments (aka active learning);</li>
  <li>on-line learning for streaming data.</li>
</ul>
